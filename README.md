## Getting started

Clone the repo to either tux or your local directory. Then, you should be able to start making changes.

## Add your files

Here are some guides for how to upload pre-existing files. Creating files in your local repo should be similar to creating files normally.
- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:


## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] If you cloned to your local computer, you can use VSCode to create a live server to test.
- [ ] If on tux, access your tux website to test code
- [ ] Make sure commits are consistent with the commit message, i.e. that what you commit is in line with what you wrote.
- [ ] Always pull before working, push when code is ready.

# Editing this README

The team should convene to decide on changes to the README. If a change receives a majority, then it will be implemented into the README.
